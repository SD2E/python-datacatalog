=====================
Developing the Schema
=====================

The overall schema is written, as much as possible, directly as JSONschema
files that are referenced by the classes and methods of the ``DataCatalog``
package. However, some parts of the schema must be built dynamically since
we don't know all the values ahead of time. This work is managed by classes
and helpers in the ``DataCatalog`` package.

Because of the dependence on code to assemble the final schema, in order to
extend the schema you will undertake a bit of Python development. Please
familiarize yourself with the Python package :doc:`architecture overview <../python/packages>`
and the guidance on how to :doc:`contribute <../python/develop>` to it.
