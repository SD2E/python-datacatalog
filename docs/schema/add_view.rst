MongoDB Views
=============

The Data Catalog MongoDB features several **views**, which are read-only, live-
updated collections matching a specific query. The production views are
maintained under source control in the ``python-datacatalog`` repository.
Because the views manifest JSON documents, they are integrated with the project
schema's namespace and build system. This makes it possible to colloboratively
update the views and define the schema of their expected outputs.
