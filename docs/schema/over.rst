JSON Schema
===========

The structure and linkage of Data Catalog collections is defined and described
by a public JSON schema whose base URL is **{{ project_schema_base_url }}**.
Over a hundred JSON schema documents are connected by reference into to form
the Data Catalog metadata schema. These documents are accessible over
HTTP/HTTPS so they can be imported dynamically into code that builds user
interfaces, performs database operations, or otherwise needs to interoperate
with the Data Catalog.
