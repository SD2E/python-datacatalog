Source Code Repository
======================

The ``python-datacatalog`` repository contains a collection of assets that
define, enable, and enforce the project metadata schema. It is comprised of
Python package source code, build support scripts, unit and integration tests,
example data, bootstrapping data, and management tools, as well as the text
and build support for the present documentation.

The repository is hosted internally by the SD2 program, but maintains a live
public mirror at `<https://github.com/SD2E/python-datacatalog>`_.
