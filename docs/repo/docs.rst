Documentation
=============

Project documentation is built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`
using the contents of the ``docs/``directory. Locally, the docs can be built
and examined at ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` using the ``make docs`` build
target. The documentation is automatically built and updated by
`ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ on every commit to the ``gh-pages`` branch.
