Text Annotations
================

Text Annotations are brief free-text documents with an optional subject line.
The message body can be up to 2 kb in size, while the subject can have up to
256 characters. A text annotation can either be associated with metadata
records in the Data Catalog or can be a child of another text annotation. In
this manner, they implemented threaded, free-form discussion around any
topic in the system. Text Annotations can be owned either by a TACC username
(the default behavior) or by any valid email address, which helps enable
persons without TACC accounts to participate in a given discussion. Text
Annotations and their replies are visble to all authenticated users.
