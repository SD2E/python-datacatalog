Redash x MongoDB
================

The **production** Data Catalog is available as **Data Catalog (Prod)**. The
**staging** database is available as **Data Catalog (Staging)**. Only read-only
access is permitted via Redash as it is a public-facing web application.

You can add additional MongoDB data sources if you are a member of the
administrator group in Redash.
