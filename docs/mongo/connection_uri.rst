Connection URI
==============

Most interfaces to MongoDB can make use of a connection URI having the form:

* ``mongodb://readonly:8cWNCPXXdcxys73zBV@catalog.sd2e.org:27123/admin?readPreference=primary``

The connection URIs included in this documentation are mock values. Please
request a connection URL from ``support at sd2e.org``.
