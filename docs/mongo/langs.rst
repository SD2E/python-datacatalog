In addition to Python, there are several other officially-supported language
kits for connecting to MongoDB. Of note are:

- `Ruby <https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/>`_
- `Java <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/?jmp=docs>`_
- `Node.js <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/?jmp=docs>`_
- `C++ <http://mongocxx.org/?jmp=docs>`_

There are also some good quality community-maintained language kits:

- `Rstats <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mongolite/>`_
- `Swift <https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten>`_
