Managers
========

Managers combine functions across multiple LinkedStores. They can be built from
basic Python objects or can inherit from ``MultiStore``. They are useful for
implementing user-facing applications atop DataCatalog. Some managers are
able to interrogate the Agave API to assist with file-level integration tasks.
