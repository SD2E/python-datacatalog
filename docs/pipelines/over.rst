=============
ETL Pipelines
=============

Multiple production ETL pipelines are actively maintained by the project. They
have each been integrated with the Data Catalog system by way of using the
Python package or by communicating with the Data Catalog Reactors. This means
that the computations they perform and the data products they generate are
discoverable via Data Catalog queries and traceable to specific pipelines,
parameter sets, sample metadata, and other values. The pipelines are maintained
independently of the Data Catalog source code and are thus documented
elsewhere.
