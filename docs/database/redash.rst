===================
Connect from Redash
===================

SD2E operates an instance of Redash `Redash <https://redash.io>`_, a general-
purpose query, reporting, and dashboard-building tool that connects to a
variety of database backends, including MongoDB. The SD2E instance is at
`dash.sd2e.org <https://dash.sd2e.org>`_ and is accessible using your TACC
login and password.

Data Sources
------------

The main, production Data Catalog is available for use in queries as
**Data Catalog (Prod)**. Only read-only access is permitted. The next versioned
release (usually with substantially differences in schema) is under
**Data Catalog (Staging)**. If the staging data source is not available to you,
that indicates there is no pre-release version available for general access.

Queries
--------

Several public queries are actively maintained by the infrastructure and data
teams. These are indicated with the `ta4` tag.

Dashboards
-----------

Several public dashboards are actively maintained by the infrastructure and data
teams. These are also indicated with the `ta4` tag.
