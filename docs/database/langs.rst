In addition to ``PyMongo``, there are several other official language-specific
MongoDB "drivers". Most notably, they include:

- `C++ <http://mongocxx.org/?jmp=docs>`_
- `Java <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/?jmp=docs>`_
- `Node.js <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/?jmp=docs>`_
- `Ruby <https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/>`_

Supplementing the offical drivers are some community-supported projects:

- `Matlab <https://github.com/gerald-lindsly/mongo-matlab-driver>`_
- `Rstats <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mongolite/>`_
- `Swift <https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten>`_
